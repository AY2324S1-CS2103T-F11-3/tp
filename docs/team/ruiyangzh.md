### Project: RealtorTrackerPlusMax

RealtorTrackerPlusMax is a desktop application made for usage by real estate agents to keep track of their
contacts, such as buyers and sellers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 10 kLoC.

* **Project management**:
  * Team lead for Week 10 (first week of v1.3)
  * 

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Restructured the system to allow for multiple types of displayable objects,
  

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
      * Wrote the detailed appendix on how we restrict inputs to fields
      * Added appendix on the warning system
      (As putting it in the main body would be repetitive and may overload users.)
      * Added appendix on how similar names are detected.
    * Developer Guide:
      * Wrote up the implementation details for the warnings feature.
      * Added some planned enhancements.
      * Rewrote the PUML diagrams and Design section to adhere to our new architecture.
